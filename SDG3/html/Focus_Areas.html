          <div class="description">

         <h2>1. Maternal Health</h2>
        <p>Reducing maternal deaths worldwide remains a critical goal. Many women, particularly in low-income regions, face childbirth without skilled birth attendants or adequate healthcare facilities. Poverty and poor infrastructure exacerbate these risks. Initiatives in countries like Ethiopia and Bangladesh, which train midwives and improve hospital services, have significantly lowered maternal mortality.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>2. Child Health</h2>
        <p>Preventing deaths of newborns and children under five is central to global health. Malnutrition, lack of vaccinations, poor sanitation, and infectious diseases continue to threaten children’s survival. Programs such as UNICEF’s vaccination campaigns have dramatically reduced fatalities from measles and polio, showing the power of targeted intervention.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>3. Communicable Diseases</h2>
        <p>Ending epidemics of AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, and neglected tropical diseases requires coordinated efforts. Challenges include drug resistance, limited healthcare access, and social stigma. The Global Fund provides prevention and treatment programs worldwide, illustrating how international collaboration can curb deadly diseases.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>4. Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs)</h2>
        <p>Chronic illnesses like heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and mental health disorders are increasingly common. Lifestyle factors, pollution, and lack of awareness contribute to their prevalence. Campaigns promoting exercise, healthy diets, and anti-smoking initiatives have proven effective in reducing these risks.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>5. Substance Abuse</h2>
        <p>Drug and alcohol abuse threaten individual and community well-being. Social stigma and limited rehabilitation centers hinder effective treatment. Education and awareness programs in schools and communities have helped reduce alcohol consumption and promote healthier choices.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>6. Universal Health Coverage</h2>
        <p>Access to essential healthcare and medicines without financial hardship is essential for well-being. High costs and uneven access, particularly in rural areas, remain major barriers. National health insurance schemes in countries like Thailand and South Korea demonstrate how policy can make healthcare more equitable.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>7. Road Safety</h2>
        <p>Road accidents claim millions of lives every year. Unsafe infrastructure, weak traffic laws, and speeding are primary causes. Awareness campaigns, stricter enforcement, and safer road design have successfully reduced fatalities in many nations.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>8. Emergency Preparedness</h2>
        <p>Strengthening health systems to respond quickly to pandemics and emergencies is vital. Limited hospital capacity and slow responses to outbreaks highlight systemic weaknesses. The COVID-19 pandemic underscored the importance of testing, vaccination, and rapid healthcare mobilization.</p>

            Hi! We’re a team of first-year college students who developed this website to help spread awareness about SDG 3. Through this project, we wanted to learn more about global health issues and share what we learned in a way that’s simple and easy to understand. We hope our website helps others appreciate how important good health and well-being are for everyone, everywhere.

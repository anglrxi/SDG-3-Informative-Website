            Why SDG 3 Matters?
          </div>
          
          <div class="description">
            
          <h2>1.Foundation for Human Development</h2> 

          Good health allows people to live longer, productive lives.

          Healthy children are more likely to attend school and perform better, which improves literacy and education outcomes.

          Healthy adults can work more effectively, contributing to economic growth.
         <br>
         <br>
          <h2>2. Reduces Poverty</h2>

          Poor health is both a cause and consequence of poverty.

          Illness can drain families financially due to medical costs or loss of income.

          By promoting health, SDG 3 helps break the cycle of poverty, allowing families to invest in education, housing, and nutrition.
          <br>
          <br>
          <h2>3. Promotes Gender Equality</h2>

          Maternal and reproductive health services empower women and girls, allowing them to make informed decisions about their lives.

          Reducing maternal and child mortality ensures equal opportunities for women to participate in education and work.
         <br>
          <br>
          <h2>4. Strengthens Economies</h2>

          A healthy workforce boosts productivity and innovation.

          Prevention of diseases reduces healthcare costs, allowing governments to invest in other sectors like education and infrastructure.

          Countries with healthier populations are more resilient to economic shocks caused by epidemics or pandemics.
         <br>
         <br>
          <h2>5. Reduces Global Health Risks <br></h2>

          Controlling epidemics (like HIV, malaria, or COVID-19) protects communities worldwide.

          Strengthening health systems and emergency preparedness prevents local outbreaks from becoming global crises.
         <br>
          <br>
          <h2>6. Improves Quality of Life <br></h2>

          SDG 3 emphasizes well-being at all ages, not just survival.

          This includes mental health, substance abuse prevention, and access to medicines, which make life more fulfilling and sustainable.
         <br>
          <br>
          <h2>7. Interconnected with Other SDGs <br></h2>

          Health affects and is affected by:

          SDG 1 (No Poverty) – poor health leads to poverty; poverty worsens health. <br> <br>

          SDG 2 (Zero Hunger) – malnutrition impacts child growth and disease resistance. <br> <br>

          SDG 4 (Quality Education) – healthy children learn better. <br> <br>

          SDG 6 (Clean Water & Sanitation) – clean water prevents disease. <br> <br>

          Achieving SDG 3 helps accelerate progress across all other SDGs. <br> <br>

            Hi! We’re a team of first-year college students who developed this website to help spread awareness about SDG 3. Through this project, we wanted to learn more about global health issues and share what we learned in a way that’s simple and easy to understand. We hope our website helps others appreciate how important good health and well-being are for everyone, everywhere.

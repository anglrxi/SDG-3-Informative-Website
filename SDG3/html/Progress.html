            Hi! We’re a team of first-year college students who developed this website to help spread awareness about SDG 3. Through this project, we wanted to learn more about global health issues and share what we learned in a way that’s simple and easy to understand. We hope our website helps others appreciate how important good health and well-being are for everyone, everywhere.

          <div class="description">
            
          <h2>1. Unequal Access to Healthcare<br></h2>

        Many people, especially in rural or poor areas, cannot access doctors, hospitals, or essential medicines.

        High costs of healthcare make it unaffordable for low-income families.<br>

        Example: In some parts of Sub-Saharan Africa, people may have to travel over 50 km to reach a clinic.<br><br>

        <h2>2. High Burden of Communicable Diseases<br></h2>

        Diseases like HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, and neglected tropical diseases remain widespread in many countries.

        Challenges include drug resistance, lack of vaccines, and poor sanitation.

        Outbreaks can overwhelm health systems (e.g., Ebola outbreak in West Africa).<br><br>

        <h2>3. Rise of Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs)<br></h2>

        Diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, cancer, and mental health disorders are increasing worldwide.

        Causes include unhealthy diets, physical inactivity, smoking, alcohol use, and pollution.

        NCDs require long-term treatment, which can strain healthcare systems.<br><br>

        <h2>4. Maternal and Child Health Challenges<br></h2>

        High maternal and child mortality persists in some regions due to poor access to skilled birth attendants and emergency care.

        Malnutrition, infectious diseases, and lack of clean water contribute to preventable deaths.<br><br>

        <h2>5. Mental Health Issues<br></h2>

        Mental health is often neglected, especially in developing countries.

        Stigma and lack of professionals make treatment and awareness difficult.

        Depression and anxiety are increasing globally, affecting productivity and quality of life.<br><br>

        <h2>6. Substance Abuse and Addiction<br></h2>

        Alcohol, tobacco, and drug abuse remain major challenges.

        Addiction treatment and prevention programs are limited in many countries.

        Substance abuse contributes to NCDs, accidents, and social problems.<br><br>

        <h2>7. Health Emergencies and Pandemics<br></h2>

        Outbreaks like COVID-19, Ebola, or Zika expose weaknesses in healthcare systems.

        Many countries lack preparedness, rapid response systems, and infrastructure to handle pandemics.<br><br>

        <h2>8. Environmental and Lifestyle Challenges<br></h2>

        Air pollution, water contamination, and climate change affect health, causing respiratory illnesses and malnutrition.

        Urbanization leads to sedentary lifestyles, unhealthy diets, and stress, contributing to NCDs.<br><br>

        <h2>9. Funding and Resource Limitations<br></h2>

        Many countries have insufficient funding for healthcare infrastructure, research, and workforce development.

        Shortage of trained medical staff (doctors, nurses, midwives) limits quality care.<br><br>

        <h2>10. Political and Social Challenges<br></h2>

        Conflict, political instability, and corruption reduce access to healthcare.

        Health systems may be disrupted in war zones, leaving people vulnerable.<br><br>

            Hi! We’re a team of first-year college students who developed this website to help spread awareness about SDG 3. Through this project, we wanted to learn more about global health issues and share what we learned in a way that’s simple and easy to understand. We hope our website helps others appreciate how important good health and well-being are for everyone, everywhere.
